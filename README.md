# Autonomous-IR-Sensing-Robot
School project, creation of autonomous IR sensing robot done in teams of four. 

This repository contains the circuitry schematics, images of the robot, and the code I helped write for my Engineering Communications and Design class (ENGR 120) during my first year of University. The files contain the finalized code ran during the main demonstration of the robot, visual representations of how the circuit works with the vex brain and the bread board designs.
